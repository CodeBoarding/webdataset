Q: Why does the `with_epoch` setting in PyTorch Lightning with WebDataset behave differently when using a `batch_size` in the DataLoader?

A: When using PyTorch Lightning with WebDataset, the `with_epoch` method is designed to define the number of samples per epoch. However, when you specify a `batch_size` in the DataLoader, `with_epoch` effectively sets the number of batches per epoch instead. This is because the DataLoader groups samples into batches, and `with_epoch` counts these batches rather than individual samples. To maintain the intended epoch size, you should divide the desired number of samples per epoch by the `batch_size`. For example, if you want 100,000 samples per epoch and your `batch_size` is 32, set `with_epoch(100_000 // 32)`.

```python
# Example adjustment for batch size
self.train_dataset = MixedWebDataset(self.cfg, self.dataset_cfg, train=True).with_epoch(100_000 // self.cfg.TRAIN.BATCH_SIZE).shuffle(4000)
```
