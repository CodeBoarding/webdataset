Q: How can I efficiently use WebDataset with Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) in PyTorch, and what is the role of `split_by_node` and `split_by_worker`?

A: When using WebDataset with DDP, the `resampled=True` option is recommended for efficient distributed training. This option ensures that shards are resampled rather than split, which can help balance the workload across nodes and workers. The `split_by_node` and `split_by_worker` parameters are used to determine how shards are distributed among nodes and workers. However, they are not necessary if `resampled=True` is used, as this option handles shard distribution automatically. If you want to ensure non-overlapping datasets across ranks, you can manually specify shard distribution using slicing, such as `tar_files[local_rank::num_available_gpus]`.

```python
trainset = (
    wds.WebDataset(tar_files, resampled=True)
    .shuffle(64)
    .decode()
    .map(make_sample)
    .batched(batch_size_per_gpu, partial=False)
)
```

This approach simplifies the setup and ensures efficient data loading in a distributed setting.
