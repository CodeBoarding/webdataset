Q: How can I use ShardWriter to write data to remote URLs?

A: ShardWriter is designed to write data to local paths only, primarily due to the complexity of error handling when writing to remote locations. However, you can work around this limitation by using a post-processing hook to upload the data to a remote location after it has been written locally. You can define a function, such as `upload_shard`, to handle the upload process. Here's an example using `gsutil` to upload files to Google Cloud Storage:

```python
def upload_shard(fname):
    os.system(f"gsutil cp {fname} gs://mybucket")
    os.unlink(fname)

with ShardWriter(..., post=upload_shard) as writer:
    ...
```

This approach allows you to leverage ShardWriter's local writing capabilities while still achieving remote storage.
