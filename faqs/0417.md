Q: Why does `wds.filters._unbatched` fail with nested dictionaries in WebDataset, and how should batched data be structured?

A: The `wds.filters._unbatched` function in WebDataset is designed to reverse the batching process, but it struggles with nested dictionaries that don't match the expected batch size. This issue arises when the `meta` field in a sample contains multiple keys or elements that don't align with the batch size. To avoid this, ensure that batched data is structured such that nested dictionaries are converted into lists of dictionaries, each corresponding to a single batch element. For example:

```python
sample = {
    'image': torch.rand(2, 3, 64, 64), 
    'cls': torch.rand(2, 100), 
    'meta': [{'paths': '/sdf/1.jpg', 'field2': torch.rand(512), 'field3': '123'},
             {'paths': '/sdf/2.jpg', 'field2': torch.rand(512), 'field3': '23423'}],
}
```

This structure ensures that each element in `meta` corresponds to a single batch item, allowing `unbatched` to process it correctly.
