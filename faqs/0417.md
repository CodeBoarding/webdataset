Q: Why does `wds.filters._unbatched` fail with nested dictionaries in WebDataset?

A: The `wds.filters._unbatched` function in WebDataset is designed to handle unbatching of data, but it does not support nested dictionaries with inconsistent batch sizes. When you have a nested dictionary, such as:

```python
sample = {
    'image': torch.rand(2, 3, 64, 64), 
    'cls': torch.rand(2, 100), 
    'meta': {
        'paths': ['/sdf/1.jpg', '/sdf/2.jpg'], 
        'field2': torch.rand(2, 512), 
        'field3': ['123', '23423'],
    },
}
```

`_unbatched` will fail if the nested elements in `meta` do not match the batch size. To avoid this, ensure that nested dictionaries are structured as lists of dictionaries, like:

```python
sample = {
    'image': torch.rand(2, 3, 64, 64), 
    'cls': torch.rand(2, 100), 
    'meta': [{...}, {...}],
}
```

This ensures consistency in batch processing and prevents errors during unbatching.
