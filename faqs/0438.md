Q: How can I combine two WebDatasets where each sample is split across different tar files?

A: Combining two WebDatasets where each sample is split across different tar files is not directly supported by WebDataset. However, you can achieve this by manually synchronizing the datasets. One approach is to use two separate WebDataset instances and synchronize them in your data loading loop. You can use PyTorch's `CombinedLoader` to load batches from each dataset and then concatenate them. Alternatively, you can manually iterate over both datasets and pair the corresponding samples. Here's a basic example:

```python
import webdataset as wds

dataset1 = wds.WebDataset("images_{000..100}.tar")
dataset2 = wds.WebDataset("glbs_{000..100}.tar")

for (img_sample, glb_sample) in zip(iter(dataset1), iter(dataset2)):
    # Combine img_sample and glb_sample as needed
    pass
```

This approach allows you to maintain separate datasets while processing them together.
