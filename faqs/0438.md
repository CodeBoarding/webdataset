Q: How can I combine two WebDataset instances where each sample is split across different tar files?

A: Combining two WebDataset instances where each sample is split across different tar files is not directly supported by WebDataset. However, you can achieve this by manually synchronizing the datasets. One approach is to use two separate WebDataset instances and synchronize them in your data loading loop. You can use PyTorch Lightning's `CombinedLoader` to load batches from each dataset and then concatenate them. Alternatively, you can manually zip the datasets by iterating over them and combining corresponding samples. Here's a basic example:

```python
import webdataset as wds

dataset1 = wds.WebDataset("images_{000..100}.tar")
dataset2 = wds.WebDataset("glbs_{000..100}.tar")

for (img_sample, glb_sample) in zip(iter(dataset1), iter(dataset2)):
    combined_sample = {**img_sample, **glb_sample}
    # Process combined_sample
```

This approach allows you to maintain separate tar files while processing combined samples.
