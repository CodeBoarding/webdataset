Q: How can I correctly iterate over a `wds.DataPipeline` in `readme.ipynb` to get the expected batch size?

A: When using `wds.DataPipeline` in `readme.ipynb`, ensure that you iterate over the `dataset` object, not a `loader`, to get the expected batch size. The pipeline should be correctly ordered to process data as intended. For instance, if you expect a batch size of 16, ensure the `wds.batched(16)` function is correctly placed in the pipeline. Here's a corrected example:

```python
batch = next(iter(dataset))  # Use dataset, not loader
```

Ensure the pipeline processes data in the correct sequence to achieve the desired output shape, such as `(torch.Size([16, 256, 256, 3]), torch.Size([16]))`.
