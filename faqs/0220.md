Q: Why does WebDataset decode keys starting with an underscore as UTF-8, and how can I ensure my `.flac` files are decoded correctly?

A: In WebDataset, keys starting with an underscore (`_`) are treated as metadata and are automatically decoded as UTF-8. This is based on the convention of using leading underscores for metadata, which is typically in UTF-8 format. If you have a file with a key like `_gbia0001334b.flac`, it might be mistakenly decoded as UTF-8. To ensure your `.flac` files are decoded correctly, make sure your keys do not start with a single underscore if they are not meant to be metadata. The system now checks for keys starting with `__` for metadata, so your case should work if you avoid single underscores for non-metadata keys. 

```python
# Example of correct key usage
dataset = wds.WebDataset("data.tar").decode(wds.torch_audio)
```
