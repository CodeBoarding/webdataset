Q: How can I handle varying `num_frames` in `npy` files when using WebDataset to avoid collation errors?

A: When using WebDataset with data that has varying dimensions, such as `npy` files with different `num_frames`, you may encounter collation errors due to the default collation function trying to create a homogeneous batch. To resolve this, you can specify a custom collation function using the `batched` method. This function should handle the varying dimensions appropriately. Alternatively, you can set `combine_tensors=False` and `combine_scalars=False` to prevent automatic collation. Here's an example of specifying a custom collation function:

```python
def custom_collate(batch):
    images, texts = zip(*batch)
    return list(images), list(texts)

pipeline.extend([
    # ... other transformations ...
    wds.batched(args.batch_size, collation_fn=custom_collate, partial=not is_train)
])
```

This approach allows your model to ingest data of varying lengths without encountering collation issues.
