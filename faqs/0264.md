Q: How can I include the file name (without extension) in the metadata dictionary during a WebDataset training loop?

A: To include the file name (without the extension) in the `metadata` dictionary during a WebDataset training loop, you can utilize the `sample["__key__"]` which contains the file name stem. You can modify the pipeline to include a mapping function that extracts this key and adds it to the `metadata`. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

```python
def add_filename_to_metadata(sample):
    sample["metadata"]["filename"] = sample["__key__"]
    return sample

pipeline = [
    wds.SimpleShardList(input_shards),
    wds.split_by_worker,
    wds.tarfile_to_samples(handler=log_and_continue),
    wds.select(filter_no_caption_or_no_image),
    wds.decode("pilrgb", handler=log_and_continue),
    wds.rename(image="jpg;png;jpeg;webp", text="txt", metadata="json"),
    wds.map(add_filename_to_metadata),
    wds.map_dict(
        image=preprocess_img,
        text=lambda text: tokenizer(text),
        metadata=lambda x: x,
    ),
    wds.to_tuple("image", "text", "metadata"),
    wds.batched(args.batch_size, partial=not is_train),
]
```

This approach ensures that each sample's metadata includes the file name stem, allowing you to access it during training.
