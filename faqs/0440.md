Q: How do I resolve the `ValueError: you need to add an explicit nodesplitter to your input pipeline for multi-node training` when using FSDP with WebDataset?

A: This error occurs because WebDataset requires an explicit `nodesplitter` to manage how data shards are distributed across multiple nodes during training. Without specifying a `nodesplitter`, the library cannot automatically determine the best way to split the data, leading to the error. To resolve this, you can use the `nodesplitter` argument in the `WebDataset` class. For example, you can use `wds.split_by_node` to split shards by node:

```python
dataset = (
    wds.WebDataset(shard_urls, resampled=True, cache_dir=data_args.local_cache_path, nodesplitter=wds.split_by_node)
    .shuffle(training_args.seed)
    .map(decode_text)
    .map(TokenizeDataset(tokenizer, max_seq_len=data_args.max_seq_length))
)
```

This ensures that each node receives a distinct subset of the data, facilitating efficient multi-node training.
