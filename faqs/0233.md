Q: How can I ensure proper shard distribution across multiple nodes and cores when using WebDataset with PyTorch in a multi-core setup?

A: To achieve correct shard distribution across multiple nodes and cores using WebDataset with PyTorch, you should utilize the `split_by_node` and `split_by_worker` functions. These functions help distribute shards across nodes and workers, respectively. For deterministic shuffling, use `detshuffle()` instead of `shuffle()`. Here's a minimal example:

```python
import webdataset as wds

dataset = wds.DataPipeline(
    wds.SimpleShardList("source-{000000..000999}.tar"),
    wds.detshuffle(),
    wds.split_by_node,
    wds.split_by_worker,
)

for idx, i in enumerate(iter(dataset)):
    print(f"rank: {rank}, world_size: {world_size}, {i}")
```

Ensure that your environment variables for `RANK`, `WORLD_SIZE`, and `LOCAL_RANK` are correctly set up for distributed training. This setup will help you achieve the desired shard distribution and shuffling behavior.
