Q: Should I use WebDataset or TorchData for my data processing needs, given the current state of development?

A: As of July 2023, active development on TorchData has been paused, and the team is re-evaluating its technical design. While WebDataset has been integrated into TorchData, you might still prefer using WebDataset for its backward compatibility and independence from Torch. Both libraries offer similar APIs, making it easy to switch between them. However, if you are looking for a stable and actively maintained solution, WebDataset might be the better choice for now. Additionally, WebDataset is being integrated with Ray and Ray AIR, providing enhanced features like shuffling and repartitioning.
