Q: How can I handle hierarchical grouping schemes in WebDataset for complex data structures like multi-frame samples or object image datasets?

A: When dealing with complex data structures in WebDataset, such as multi-frame samples or object image datasets, you can use hierarchical naming schemes with separators like `.` to define relationships between files. However, for more complex structures, it's often easier to use a flat naming scheme and express the hierarchy in a JSON file. For example, you can name your files sequentially and include a JSON file that describes the structure:

```plaintext
sample_0.000.jpg
sample_0.001.jpg
sample_0.002.jpg
sample_0.json
```

In your JSON file, you can define the hierarchy explicitly:

```json
{
    "frames": ["000.jpg", "001.jpg", "002.jpg"],
    "timestamps": [...],
    "duration": ...
}
```

This approach allows you to maintain a clear and manageable structure without overcomplicating the file naming conventions.
