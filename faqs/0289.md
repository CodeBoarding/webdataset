Q: Can WebDataset support interleaved datasets with multiple images per example, such as MMC4?

A: Yes, WebDataset can support interleaved datasets where an example may contain multiple images. This can be achieved by using a hierarchical structure similar to a file system. You can represent this structure in a JSON file that references the image files, and then include the image files in the same sample. This approach allows you to handle complex datasets with multiple images per example efficiently.

Example JSON structure:
```json
{
  "text": "Example text",
  "images": ["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg", "image3.jpg"]
}
```

Ensure that the images are stored alongside the JSON file within the dataset.
