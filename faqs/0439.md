Q: What happens if I swap `.shuffle()` and `.decode()` in a WebDataset pipeline?

A: Swapping `.shuffle()` and `.decode()` in a WebDataset pipeline affects memory usage. When you shuffle before decoding, the samples are stored in a shuffle buffer in their encoded form, which is typically smaller. This results in lower memory usage. Conversely, if you decode before shuffling, the samples are stored in their decoded form, which is larger, leading to higher memory usage. Therefore, it's generally more efficient to shuffle before decoding to optimize memory usage.

```python
# Shuffle before decode (more memory efficient)
dataset = wds.WebDataset(urls).shuffle(1000).decode()

# Decode before shuffle (less memory efficient)
dataset = wds.WebDataset(urls).decode().shuffle(1000)
```
