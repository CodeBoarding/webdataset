Q: What is the impact of swapping `.shuffle()` and `.decode()` in a WebDataset pipeline?

A: Swapping `.shuffle()` and `.decode()` in a WebDataset pipeline affects memory usage. When you shuffle before decoding, the samples are stored in a shuffle buffer in their encoded form, which is typically smaller. This results in lower memory usage. Conversely, if you decode before shuffling, the samples are stored in their decoded form, which is larger, leading to higher memory usage. Therefore, for efficient memory management, it's generally better to shuffle before decoding.

```python
# Shuffle before decode (lower memory usage)
dataset = wds.WebDataset(urls).shuffle(1000).decode()

# Decode before shuffle (higher memory usage)
dataset = wds.WebDataset(urls).decode().shuffle(1000)
```
