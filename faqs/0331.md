Q: How can I handle gzipped tar files with WIDS when loading the SAM dataset?

A: When using WIDS to load the SAM dataset, you may encounter issues with gzipped tar files, as WIDS does not natively support random access in compressed tar files. The recommended approach is to use uncompressed tar files, which allows for efficient data loading. You can still compress individual files within the tar using formats like `.json.gz`, which WIDS can automatically decompress. If you need to reorder files within a tar, you can unpack and retar them using GNU tar with sorting:

```bash
tar --sort=name -cvf archive.tar .
```

This ensures compatibility and efficient data access with WIDS.
