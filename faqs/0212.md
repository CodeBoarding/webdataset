Q: How does caching affect the download and processing of shards in WebDataset, and can the cache name be customized?

A: When using WebDataset with caching enabled, each shard is downloaded completely before processing, which can delay the start of training. This is because caching requires the entire shard to be available locally before it can be used, unlike streaming, which processes data as it arrives. To customize the cache name, you can override the `url_to_name` argument to map shard names to cache file names as desired. This allows for more control over how cached files are named and stored locally.

```python
dataset = wds.WebDataset("pipe:s3 http://url/dataset-{001..099}.tar", url_to_name=my_custom_naming_function)
```
