Q: How can I resolve the issue of incorrect shard caching filenames when using `s3cmd` in a URL with WebDataset?

A: When using `s3cmd` in a URL with WebDataset, you might encounter an issue where the cache directory only contains a single file named `s3cmd`, leading to incorrect shard usage. This happens because the `pipe_cleaner` function in `webdataset/cache.py` incorrectly identifies `s3cmd` as the URL. To resolve this, you can override the default URL-to-name mapping by specifying the `url_to_name` option in the `cached_url_opener`. This allows you to customize how URLs are mapped to cache filenames, ensuring each shard is cached correctly.

```python
# Example of overriding the URL-to-name mapping
dataset = WebDataset(urls, url_to_name=lambda url: hash(url))
```

This approach ensures that each shard is uniquely identified and cached properly.
