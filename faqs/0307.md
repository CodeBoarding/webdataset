Q: How can I avoid loading unnecessary files into memory when using WebDataset with tar files?

A: When using WebDataset to process tar files, you might want to avoid loading certain files, like large images, into memory. While WebDataset streams data, meaning it reads all bytes, you can use the `select_files` argument to specify which files to load. Alternatively, consider using the "wids" interface for indexed access, which only reads the data you use. If performance is a concern, creating a new dataset with only the necessary fields is advisable.

```python
dataset = wds.WebDataset(["path/to/dataset.tar"], select_files="*.txt")
```

This approach helps in efficiently managing memory usage by only loading required files.
