Q: How can I combine multiple datasets with non-integer sampling frequencies and use them in a multiprocess/GPU setup?

A: To combine datasets with non-integer sampling frequencies, you can use the `RandomMix` function, which allows you to specify the sampling ratio for each dataset. For example, if you want to sample from dataset `A` 1.45 times more frequently than from dataset `B`, you can adjust the weights accordingly. In a multiprocess/GPU setup, ensure that each process or GPU has access to the mixed dataset. Here's a basic example:

```python
ds1 = WebDataset("A/{00..99}.tar")
ds2 = WebDataset("B/{00..99}.tar")
mix = RandomMix([ds1, ds2], [1.45, 1.0])
```

For multiprocessing, you can use libraries like `torch.multiprocessing` or `multiprocessing` to distribute the workload across processes, ensuring each process accesses the mixed dataset independently.
