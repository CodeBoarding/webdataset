Q: How can I resolve the "empty shards" error when using WebDataset's Column Store in a multi-node, multi-worker setup?

A: When using WebDataset's Column Store in a multi-node, multi-worker environment, you might encounter "empty shards" errors due to improper handling of node and worker splitting. This occurs because the `add_column` function initializes a `WebDataset` with a single shard, which can lead to empty slices when split by node or worker. To resolve this, set both `nodesplitter` and `workersplitter` to `None` in the `WebDataset` within `add_column`. Additionally, if resampling is used, set `resampled=True` to avoid `StopIteration` errors. Here's an example of how to modify the `add_column` function:

```python
import webdataset as wds

def add_column(src, find_column_url=find_column_url):
    last_url = None
    column_src = None
    for sample in src:
        if last_url != sample["__url__"]:
            column_url = find_column_url(sample["__url__"])
            column_src = iter(
                wds.WebDataset(
                    column_url,
                    resampled=True,
                    shardshuffle=False,
                    nodesplitter=None,
                    workersplitter=None,
                )
            )
            last_url = sample["__url__"]
        extra = next(column_src)
        assert extra["__key__"] == sample["__key__"]
        for k, v in extra.items():
            if k[0] != "_":
                sample[k] = v
        yield sample
```

This approach ensures that the additional column data is consumed correctly without splitting, preventing the "empty shards" error.
