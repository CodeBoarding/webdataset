Q: How can I better understand the `with_epoch()` method in WebDataset, and is there a more descriptive name for it?

A: The `with_epoch()` method in WebDataset is used to set the epoch length explicitly, which is crucial for distributed training. However, its name can be confusing. A more descriptive name like `.set_one_epoch_samples()` could clarify its purpose, but changing it would be incompatible with existing code. To better understand its usage, consider the following example:

```python
dataset = WebDataset(urls).with_epoch(1000)
```

This sets the epoch length to 1000 samples. Improving documentation with detailed explanations and examples can help users grasp its functionality without renaming the method.
