Q: How can I manage memory issues when using WebDataset with multiple buckets of different image sizes?

A: When using WebDataset to handle datasets organized by image size, memory issues can arise due to improper data handling, especially when using `itertools.cycle` which can lead to memory leaks. To avoid this, ensure that you do not use `shuffle` within each component dataset. Instead, create a custom `IterableDataset` that samples from all tarfiles across buckets and then apply shuffling at the pipeline level. This approach helps manage memory usage effectively and ensures that batches are correctly formed from the same bucket. Here's a basic structure:

```python
class MyBucketSampler(IterableDataset):
    def __iter__(self):
        # Implement your sampling logic here

bucketsampler = MyBucketSampler(...)

dataset = wds.DataPipeline(
    bucketsampler,
    wds.shuffle(...),
    wds.batched(...),
)
```

This setup ensures efficient memory usage and proper data sampling across buckets.
