Q: How can I provide credentials to access a private bucket when using WebDataset with a provider other than AWS or GCS?

A: To access a private bucket with WebDataset using a provider other than AWS or GCS, you can provide credentials in the same way you would for command-line tools. WebDataset uses command-line programs to handle data, so if you can authenticate using these tools, WebDataset will work seamlessly. For example, if your provider offers a command-line tool for accessing buckets, ensure it is configured with your `access key id` and `secret access key`. You can also use the `pipe:` URL scheme to execute a shell command for reading data, allowing you to incorporate custom scripts for authentication.

```bash
# Example of using a custom command with WebDataset
pipe:my_custom_command --access-key-id YOUR_ACCESS_KEY --secret-access-key YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

Ensure your command-line environment is set up correctly to authenticate with your provider's tools.
