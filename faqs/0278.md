Q: Why is `with_epoch(N)` needed for multi-node training with WebDataset, and how does it differ from PyTorch's `set_epoch`?

A: In multi-node training with WebDataset, `with_epoch(N)` is essential when dealing with an infinite stream of samples, as it allows you to define epochs by specifying the number of batches (`N`) per epoch. Without it, the training loop could run indefinitely, as WebDataset is designed to provide a continuous stream of data. Unlike PyTorch's `DataLoader` which uses `set_epoch` to shuffle data across epochs, WebDataset's `IterableDataset` interface does not support `set_epoch`. Therefore, `with_epoch(N)` is crucial for managing epochs in WebDataset.

```python
# Example usage of with_epoch in WebDataset
dataset = wds.WebDataset(urls).with_epoch(N)
```

This ensures that your training process aligns with the expected epoch-based workflow.
