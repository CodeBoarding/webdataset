Q: How can I detect when a tarball has been fully consumed by `tariterators.tar_file_expander`?

A: To detect when a tarball has been fully consumed, you can implement a mechanism that tracks the consumption of tar files. For local files, monkey patching the `tar_file_iterator` function allows you to access the file name from `fileobj`. However, for remote files, which use `io.BytesIO` objects, you can add metadata to samples, such as `__index_in_shard__`. When this index is 0, it indicates that the last shard was fully consumed. This approach can also resolve issues with single-sample tars, preventing duplicate key errors.

```python
# Example of adding metadata to track consumption
sample['__index_in_shard__'] = index_in_shard
if sample['__index_in_shard__'] == 0:
    print("Last shard fully consumed.")
```

This method provides a reliable way to monitor the consumption of tar files, especially in scenarios involving remote files.
