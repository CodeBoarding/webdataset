Q: How can I skip a sample if decoding fails in a dataset using NVIDIA DALI or WebDataset?

A: When working with datasets, especially large ones, you might encounter corrupt samples that fail to decode. To handle such cases gracefully in NVIDIA DALI or WebDataset, you can use the `handler` parameter. This parameter allows you to specify a function, such as `warn_and_continue`, which will log the error and skip the problematic sample without interrupting the entire data processing pipeline. Here's an example of how to implement this in WebDataset:

```python
import webdataset as wds

def warn_and_continue(exn):
    print(f"Warning: {exn}")
    return True

ds = (
    wds.WebDataset(url, handler=warn_and_continue, shardshuffle=True, verbose=True)
    .map(_mapper, handler=warn_and_continue)
    .to_tuple("jpg", "cls")
    .map_tuple(transform, identity, handler=warn_and_continue)
    .batched(batch_size)
)
```

By using `warn_and_continue`, you ensure that the dataset processing continues even if some samples are corrupt.
