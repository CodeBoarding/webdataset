Q: How does WebDataset handle the conversion of local JPG images and text into NPY files?

A: WebDataset does not inherently convert JPG images and text into NPY files. Instead, it writes data in the format specified by the file extension in the sample keys. When using `ShardWriter`, you can specify the format by the file extension in the key. For example, if you write a sample with `{"__key__": "xyz", "image.jpg": some_tensor}`, it will be saved as a JPEG file. Conversely, if you use `{"__key__": "xyz", "image.npy": some_tensor}`, it will be saved in NPY format. Upon reading, both formats can be decoded into tensors using appropriate arguments.

```python
writer = ShardWriter(...)
image = rand((256,256,3))
sample["__key__"] = "dataset/sample00003"
sample["data.npy"] = image
sample["jpg"] = image
writer.write(sample)
```

This flexibility allows you to choose the desired format for your data storage and retrieval.
