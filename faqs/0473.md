Q: How can I avoid "Broken pipe" errors when using `pipe:`-wrapped S3 URLs in WebDataset?

A: If you encounter "Broken pipe" errors when using `pipe:`-wrapped S3 URLs in WebDataset, it may be due to frequent reconnections. A workaround is to replace the `pipe:` pattern with a custom `gopen` handler using a streaming S3 client like `boto3`. This approach stabilizes the connection by maintaining a persistent client session. Here's a minimal example:

```python
import functools
import webdataset
import boto3
from cloudpathlib import S3Path
from cloudpathlib.anypath import to_anypath

@functools.lru_cache()
def boto3_client():
    return boto3.client("s3", region_name="us-east-1")

def load_s3_url(url, *_args, **_kwargs):
    path = to_anypath(url)
    bucket = path.bucket
    key = path.key
    client = boto3_client()
    response = client.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key)
    return response["Body"]

webdataset.gopen_schemes["s3"] = load_s3_url
```

This method streams data directly from S3, potentially improving memory usage and reducing errors. Consider suggesting a feature to allow custom `gopen_schemes` in WebDataset for more flexibility.
