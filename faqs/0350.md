Q: What is the difference between `WebDataset.shuffle` and `WebLoader.shuffle`, and how do their parameters affect dataset shuffling?

A: `WebDataset.shuffle` shuffles samples within each shard, while `WebLoader.shuffle` shuffles the samples across the entire dataset. The parameter in `WebLoader.shuffle(n)` determines the buffer size used for shuffling. A larger buffer size, like `shuffle(5000)`, provides better randomness but requires more memory, while a smaller buffer size, like `shuffle(1000)`, uses less memory but may result in less effective shuffling. For a dataset of 13,000 samples, using a buffer size that balances memory usage and shuffling effectiveness is key. Experiment with different sizes to find the optimal balance for your specific use case.

```python
dataset = WebDataset(..., shardshuffle=100).shuffle(...) ... .batched(64)
dataloader = WebLoader(dataset, num_workers=..., ...).unbatched().shuffle(5000).batched(batch_size)
```
