Q: How can I ensure that WebLoader-generated batches are different across nodes during multi-node DDP training with WebDataset?

A: To ensure that WebLoader-generated batches are different across nodes during multi-node DDP training, you can use the `resampled=True` option in `WebDataset`. This option allows each worker to generate an infinite stream of samples, preventing DDP from hanging due to uneven batch sizes. Additionally, you can use `.repeat(n).with_epoch(m)` to control the number of iterations and epoch length. It's crucial to have a number of shards divisible by the total number of workers, with equal samples in each shard, to avoid duplication and missing samples. Here's a simple example:

```python
dataset = WebDataset(..., resampled=True).repeat(2).with_epoch(n)
```

This setup ensures that each worker processes data independently, reducing the chance of duplicate samples and synchronization issues.
