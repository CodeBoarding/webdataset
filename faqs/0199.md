Q: Why is `wds.Processor` not available in the `v2` or `main` branch of WebDataset, and how can I add preprocessing steps to my data?

A: The `wds.Processor` class, along with `wds.Shorthands` and `wds.Composable`, has been removed from the `v2` and `main` branches of WebDataset as the architecture for pipelines has been updated to align more closely with `torchdata`. To add preprocessing steps, you can use the `map` function, which allows you to apply a function to each sample in the dataset. The function receives the complete sample as an argument. Additionally, you can create custom pipeline stages by writing them as callables. Here's an example:

```python
def process(source):
    for sample in source:
        # ... code goes here ...

ds = WebDataset(...).compose(process)
```

This approach provides flexibility in accessing and processing the complete sample data.
