Q: How can I efficiently load only a subset of files from a sample in WebDataset to save on decoding time?

A: When working with WebDataset, you can use the `select_files` option to specify which files to extract from a sample. This approach allows you to skip unnecessary files, reducing the decoding time for files you don't need. However, keep in mind that skipping files may not significantly speed up the process due to the nature of hard drive operations, where seeking can be as time-consuming as reading. For optimal performance, consider pre-selecting the files you need during training and organizing your tar files accordingly.

Example usage:
```python
import webdataset as wds

dataset = wds.WebDataset("data.tar").select_files("*.main.jpg", "*.aux0.jpg")
```

This configuration will only load the specified files, potentially saving on decoding time.
