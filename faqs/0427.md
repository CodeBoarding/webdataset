Q: How can I enforce caching of datasets stored on a local filesystem when using WebDataset?

A: By default, WebDataset does not cache datasets that are already stored on a local filesystem. However, if you want to enforce caching even for local files, you can use a workaround by utilizing the `pipe:` URL schema. This involves using a command like `pipe:cat filename.tar` to read the dataset, which will then be cached if a `cache_dir` is specified. This approach effectively forces the caching mechanism to engage, even for local filesystem paths.

```bash
# Example command to enforce caching
dataset = WebDataset("pipe:cat /path/to/your/dataset.tar", cache_dir="/path/to/cache")
```

This method ensures that your dataset is cached locally, improving access speed for future iterations.
