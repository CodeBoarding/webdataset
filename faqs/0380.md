Q: How does caching work in WebDataset, and does it affect the start of training?

A: In WebDataset, caching is designed to download each shard completely before using it for further processing. This means that while the training job can start immediately, it will use the local copy of the shard once it is fully downloaded. This approach was adopted to simplify error handling, as opposed to the original method where caching and processing happened in parallel. Here's a simple example of how you might set up a WebDataset pipeline:

```python
import webdataset as wds

dataset = wds.WebDataset("shards/{0000..9999}.tar").decode("rgb").to_tuple("jpg", "cls")
for sample in dataset:
    # process sample
```

This ensures that your training job doesn't have to wait for all shards to download before starting, but each shard is processed only after being fully cached.
